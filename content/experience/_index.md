## 👨‍💻 Software Developer at Telenor AS (Aug 2022 - now)
As a backend Java and Kotlin developer at Telenor, I've played a crucial role in developing and maintaining over 50 APIs. Not only was I responsible for building and improving functionalities, but I also optimized for performance and security. I've guided new developers through the maze of internal tools, libraries, and procedures, and have played an active role in implementing efficient work methodologies.

A key aspect of my role was also to modernize our tech stack, which included migrating our applications, as well as standardizing our development practices. This ensured that we were leveraging the latest advancements and following industry best practices.

Being part of Telenor's Security Champion program, I strengthened our IT security, taking part in comprehensive risk analysis, security management, and preventive measures.

I participated in a significant technological shift where we moved approximately 50 APIs from on-premises servers to a cloud-based environment. This initiative improved scalability and reliability by leveraging the advantages that cloud services can offer.

### 🛠️ Internal Tooling @Telenor
In addition to external projects, I also helped enhance our internal tools at Telenor. This included refining the OpenAPI tools, improving our logging systems, and optimizing feature toggle functionality. These improvements resulted in more efficient and streamlined development workflows.

### 📊 Monitoring and Visualization @Telenor
In an effort to improve visibility into our systems and enhance performance tracking, I led the creation of multiple dashboards using Grafana and Prometheus. These tools have been instrumental in monitoring system health, identifying issues early, and making data-driven decisions.

### 🚀 Leading Kotlin Adoption @Telenor
As a firm believer in Kotlin's potential, I led a proof-of-concept project to demonstrate its benefits and usability in Telenor's development environment. This involved creating a new API entirely in Kotlin, showcasing its concise syntax, strong type-safety, and functional programming features. This initiative played a significant role in driving the adoption of Kotlin in Telenor.

### 🔄 GitHub Migration Lead @Telenor
Recognizing the need for a more robust and feature-rich version control system within our division, I took the reins in migrating our code repositories to GitHub. This pivotal task involved careful planning, coordination, and execution to ensure a seamless transition of our codebase, while minimizing disruptions to ongoing projects. This move to GitHub has significantly enhanced our team's collaboration capabilities and streamlined our development workflow.
